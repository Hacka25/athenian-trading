For this project, you will need to use the following files and their respective purposes:

1. `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`: These are the Gradle wrappers used to run the Gradle build system. They ensure that the correct version of Gradle is used with your project.

2. `build.gradle`: This file contains the configuration for your Gradle build, such as dependencies, plugins, and tasks.

3. `settings.gradle`: This file configures the structure of your Gradle project, such as the location of the main source code and any additional sub-projects.

4. `.gitignore`: This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing changes to the repository.

5. `Procfile`: This file is used by Heroku to determine how to run your application. In this case, it specifies that the web server should be started with the command "java -Dagent.config=resources/application.conf -jar build/libs/server.j".

6. The various shell scripts (`*.sh` files) are used by Gradle to perform specific tasks during the build process.

7. `src/main/groovy`: This directory contains your main source code, written in Groovy.

8. `resources`: This directory contains any additional resources required by your application, such as configuration files or templates.

9. `build/libs/server.jar` (or `.war`): This is the output of your Gradle build process - a runnable JAR or WAR file that can be executed by the Java command.

10. The various `*.gradle` files contain configuration settings for specific plugins or tasks used in your project's build process.
